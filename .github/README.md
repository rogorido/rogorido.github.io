# Academic Portfolio

This is the code for generating the [Academic
Portfolio](https://rogorido.github.io) of Igor Sosa Mayor.

It is based on [Astro Academia
Documentation](https://github.com/maiobarbero/astro_academia) created by
[Matteo Barbero](https://github.com/maiobarbero). Nevertheless I made
[many
modifications](https://github.com/maiobarbero/astro_academia/compare/main...rogorido:rogorido.github.io:main)
to the work done by Matteo.

It uses the fabulous web framework [Astro](https://astro.build/).

# Disclaimer

I do not recommend to use this code for your own site. It is too adapted
to my needs. It is better you take the code written by Matteo.
