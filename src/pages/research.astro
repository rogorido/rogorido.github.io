      <p class="mb-6 text-lg">
        My main period of research is the early modern history, specially
        religious changes and their relationships with intellectual, social and
        geopolitical changes. I have published about catholic moral theology and
        the transformations of the noble class in the early modern period. I
        have researched the Dominican Order from a global perspective: its
        expansion, the management of educational aspects of the Order during its
        global expansion, the presence and role played by the Orders' bishops in
        the global catholic expansion, and so on.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-6 text-lg">
        I have extensively used methods of the so called Digital Humanities:
        content analysis, geoanalysis, and data visualizations, among others.
